# PRD: i18n Cleanup & Translation Consolidation

## Business Goal
Simplify translation management by eliminating duplicated JSON files that cause build-time errors and drift.  
Guarantee that both languages (pl and en) always share an identical set of keys.

## Functional Scope
1. **Remove** the `/static/locales` directory and all code or configuration references to it.  
2. **Audit** JSON keys in the remaining `/locales` tree (pl vs en) and detect any missing or mismatched entries  
   – e.g. `specialties_section_title` vs `specialties_title`.  
3. **Introduce automatic key validation** on every commit:  
   - Use either a TypeScript enum **or** a JSON Schema + npm script (`npm run i18n:check`).  
4. *(Nice-to-have)* Add a **README** section explaining how to add new keys and run the validator.

## Technical Requirements
- Continue using **gatsby-plugin-react-i18next** with `localeJsonSourceName: "locale"`.  
- Project targets **Node 20** (consistent with other tasks).  
- No external services are required – everything runs locally.

## Priority
**High** – this blocks further work on translations and UI polish.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `gatsby develop` and `gatsby build` finish with **no warnings** about duplicated locale files.  
- The validator exits with code 0 when both languages have complete key coverage; non-zero otherwise.  
- README contains a clearly labelled **"i18n Workflow"** section.
